I'm interested in the composition of audio for fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries: sound made for radio, novels, games, and narration, for instance. This sort of sound is distinct from the use of audio to document literary performances. It's less about recording or capturing an event and more about composition and editing, including the sound effects and soundscapes of fiction. It also tends to involve acousmatic listening, where the source(s) of a sound cannot be seen or determined.  

For this session, I thought we could listen to key moment in that history of audio and fiction, namely two audio works by Delia Derbyshire (5 May 1937 â€“ 3 July 2001), who was at the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop in [Maida Vale Studios](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5262781,-0.1909051,3a,75y,222.79h,90.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-RpzF9BJ2aBun5N8pqA70Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from 1962 until 1973.
