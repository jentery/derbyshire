# SpokenWeb Listening Session

I'm interested in the composition of audio for fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries: sound made for radio, novels, games, and narration, for instance. This sort of sound is distinct from the use of audio to document literary performances. It's less about recording or capturing an event and more about composition and editing, including the sound effects and soundscapes of fiction. It also tends to involve acousmatic listening, where the source(s) of a sound cannot be seen or determined.  

For this session, I thought we could listen to key moment in that history of audio and fiction, namely two audio works by Delia Derbyshire (5 May 1937 – 3 July 2001), who was at the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop in [Maida Vale Studios](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5262781,-0.1909051,3a,75y,222.79h,90.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-RpzF9BJ2aBun5N8pqA70Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from 1962 until 1973. Derbyshire is best known for [original *Doctor Who* theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkIEkLww3lg), for which she went uncredited. Here's her preferred version of theme, from 1963. It's the original. (Audio care of Martin Guy.)

While contributing at the Radiophonic Workshop, Derbyshire also composed everything from signature tunes and sound effects to incidental music and interventions in radio. She experimented in the style of musique concrète with voices, doors, lampshades, chess, animal sounds, dreams, afterlives, imagined pasts, and possible futures. She composed for BBC Television and Radio.

Below I focus on the entanglements of Derbyshire's sounds with science fiction. The two pieces I selected are "Science and Health" and "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO."
