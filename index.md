I'm interested in the creation of audio for fiction in the 20th and 21st centuries: sound made for radio, novels, games, and narration, for instance. This sort of sound is distinct from the use of audio to document literary performances. It's less about capturing or recording than composing and editing. It also tends to involve acousmatic listening, where the source(s) of a sound cannot be seen or determined.  

For this [SpokenWeb](https://spokenweb.ca/) listening session, I thought we could attend to a key moment in audio's history in fiction, namely two audio works by Delia Derbyshire (5 May 1937 – 3 July 2001), who was at the BBC's Radiophonic Workshop in [Maida Vale Studios](https://www.google.com/maps/@51.5262781,-0.1909051,3a,75y,222.79h,90.48t/data=!3m6!1e1!3m4!1s-RpzF9BJ2aBun5N8pqA70Q!2e0!7i16384!8i8192) from 1962 until 1973. She arrived after [Daphne Oram's](https://www.bbc.com/culture/article/20170522-daphne-oram-pioneered-electronic-music) departure from the BBC in 1959 and is now best known for producing the [original *Doctor Who* theme](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkIEkLww3lg), for which she went uncredited. Here's her preferred version of the theme, from 1963. I believe it's the first version she made. (OGG file care of Martin Guy.)

While contributing to the Radiophonic Workshop, Derbyshire composed everything from signature tunes and sound effects to incidental music and [inventions for radio](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Inventions_for_Radio). She experimented in the style of musique concrète with voices, doors, lampshades, chess, animal sounds, dreams, afterlives, imagined pasts, and possible futures. She made sound for BBC Television and Radio without the use of a computer or samples.

Derbyshire's [archive](https://deliaderbyshireday.com/dd-archive/), including [her papers](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/search-resources/special-collections/guide-to-special-collections/a-to-z/collection/?match=Delia+Derbyshire+Papers) and some [digitized materials](https://www.library.manchester.ac.uk/using-the-library/staff/digitisation-services/projects/delia-derbyshire/), are at the University of Manchester. For more about her work and the Radiophonic Workshop, see Kara Blake's [*The Delian Mode*](https://thedelianmode.com/) (Philtre Films, 2009), [*Sculptress of Sound: The Lost Works of Delia Derbyshire*](https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rl2ky) (BBC Radio, March 2010), [*The Alchemists of Sound*](http://www.ubu.com/film/alchemists.html) (BBC Documentary, 2003), Louis Niebur's [*Special Sound: The Creation and Legacy of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop*](https://global.oup.com/ushe/product/special-sound-9780195368406?cc=ca&lang=en&) (Oxford U P, 2010), and [David Butler's 2019 piece](https://www.bbc.com/historyofthebbc/100-voices/pioneering-women/women-of-the-workshop/delia-derbyshire) for the "History of the BBC." 

Below I focus on the entanglements of Derbyshire's sounds with science fiction. The two pieces I selected are "Science and Health" and "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO." 

## "Science and Health"

"Science and Health," from 1964, recorded on a 5" reel, 1/4" tape. 01:05 minutes 

Audio and provenance care of [Martin Guy](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Science_and_Health): 

> "In 1964, Delia [Derbyshire] created a 57-second signature tune for a BBC radio series[,] 'For Schools - Health and Science', which she named ['Science and Health'](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/TRW#6152), 'a succession of tumbling chords, descending with an elegance beyond almost anyone else' (see Robin Carmody's ["Wee Have Also Sound-Houses"](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Wee_have_also_sound-houses_(article))). "The programme was actually called 'For Schools - Health and Science', not 'Science and Health'. The [*Radio Times* listing](https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/0b6cbbb9c6bb422ab0bf8ce745a85dcc) initially only credits the programme as 'compiled by Michael Smee.' Later in the series, the *Radio Times* provided [a fuller credit](https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/61bf87094117409587e663c4528b4388)[:] 'Reproduction 4: Bringing up children by Michael Smee Series produced and edited by Elizabeth Kilham Roberts.'"

The piece was never broadcasted. Either Smee or Kilham Roberts ultimately rejected the tune for use in their sex education programme, reportedly deeming it too "lascivious." Derbyshire decided to resplice parts of the piece for "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO."

## "Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO"

"Ziwzih Ziwzih OO-OO-OO," broadcast at 10:05pm on 1st January 1967 on BBC2. Recorded on a 7" reel, 1/4" tape, at 7.5ips. 10:53 minutes.

Audio and provenance again care of [Martin Guy](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Ziwzih%20Ziwzih%20OO-OO-OO): 

This particular piece not only respliced "Science and Health" but also served as the theme for an episode in the BBC television series, *Out of the Unknown*. The episode was titled, ["The Prophet,"](https://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/845a0724283b4cc2ae96313b7a329d39) and adapted Isaac Asimov's short story, "Reason," about QT-1 ("Cutie"), a robot prophet who rejects human commands to lead an automata rebellion in the name of their ship's energy converter (their "Master").

Here's Derbyshire talking about her work for *Out of the Unknown* in a 1997 [Radio Scotland interview](https://wikidelia.net/wiki/Radio_Scotland_interview): 

> "Most of the programs that I did were either in the far distant future, the far distant past or in the mind. I think this was the climax of a science fiction play called 'The Prophet'. It ended up with all these robots and they sang a song of praise to this bloke, presumably the prophet, and this was the song they sang. It is difficult to pronounce because it's made from backwards chanting and I think if you play it forwards it would say something like 'Praise to the master, his wisdom and his reason' and I just chose the best bits and 'Ziwzih Ziwzih', 'his wiz, his wiz': it's that backwards."
